To get Chombo4 to compile, you need a Make.defs.local.
It should have in it defined:

PROTO_HOME = "where you put proto"

CHOMBO_DEPXX="compiler to do dependencies"
CHOMBO_CXX="compiler to compile" (mpicc, g++... whatever)


CHOMBO_HDFINCFLAGS="include flags for hdf5"
CHOMBO_HDFLIBFLAGS="link flags for hdf5"

CHOMBO_CXXALLFLAGS+= "compilaiton flags you want in all cses"
CHOMBO_DEPFLAGS += "dependency flags"
CHOMBO_LIBS+="libs to which you want to link"

#machine-specific reading material:

Igor notes:
Make.defs.igor ought to work

ANAG notes.
Make.defs.ANAG.serial/Make.defs.ANAG.parallel should work

Crusher notes:
For CC (no gpu), Make.defs.crusher.CC ought to work.
For hipcc (gpu):
module load PrgEnv-amd hdf5 craype-accel-amd-gfx90a rocm
