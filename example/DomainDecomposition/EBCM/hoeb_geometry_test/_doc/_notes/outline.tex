To test what I really want to test, I only really need EBCMGraph to have two functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Iterate through the vofs on a box.
\item Get the neighborhood of a particular VoF.
\end{itemize}
To make pictures for papers I would also need
\begin{itemize}
\item Data holders
\item Some way to visualize data
\item Might be a good idea to be able to push data on to EB data
  holders for viz.
\end{itemize}
