\section{hoeb geometry test}

This test makes a single-box EBCM::MetaDataLevel.  It then makes a ton
of data on matrix conditioning in an hoeb/ebcm context.    The
associated technical report is quite complete.

\section{hoeb spmd}

This tests the communications infrastructure for {\tt
Chombo4/src/EBCM}, the bits of Chombo that handle calculations
within the context merged and
unmerged cut cell geometries.   The associated document is complete
but minimal.


\section{hoeb petsc}

This test investigates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of stencils to
solve Poisson's equation.
