Options for all PETSc programs:
 -version: prints PETSc version
 -help intro: prints example description and PETSc version, and exits
 -help: prints example description, PETSc version, and available options for used routines
 -on_error_abort: cause an abort when an error is detected. Useful 
        only when run in the debugger
 -on_error_attach_debugger [gdb,dbx,xxgdb,ups,noxterm]
       start the debugger in new xterm
       unless noxterm is given
 -start_in_debugger [gdb,dbx,xxgdb,ups,noxterm]
       start all processes in the debugger
 -on_error_emacs <machinename>
    emacs jumps to error file
 -debugger_ranks [n1,n2,..] Ranks to start in debugger
 -debugger_pause [m] : delay (in seconds) to attach debugger
 -stop_for_debugger : prints message on how to attach debugger manually
                      waits the delay for you to attach
 -display display: Location where X window graphics and debuggers are displayed
 -no_signal_handler: do not trap error signals
 -mpi_return_on_error: MPI returns error code, rather than abort on internal error
 -fp_trap: stop on floating point exceptions
           note on IBM RS6000 this slows run greatly
 -malloc_dump <optional filename>: dump list of unfreed memory at conclusion
 -malloc: use PETSc error checking malloc (deprecated, use -malloc_debug)
 -malloc no: don't use PETSc error checking malloc (deprecated, use -malloc_debug no)
 -malloc_info: prints total memory usage
 -malloc_view <optional filename>: keeps log of all memory allocations, displays in PetscFinalize()
 -malloc_debug <true or false>: enables or disables extended checking for memory corruption
 -options_view: dump list of options inputted
 -options_left: dump list of unused options
 -options_left no: don't dump list of unused options
 -tmp tmpdir: alternative /tmp directory
 -shared_tmp: tmp directory is shared by all processors
 -not_shared_tmp: each processor has separate tmp directory
 -memory_view: print memory usage at end of run
 -get_total_flops: total flops over all processors
 -log_view [:filename:[format]]: logging objects and events
 -log_trace [filename]: prints trace of all PETSc calls
 -log_exclude <list,of,classnames>: exclude given classes from logging
 -info [filename][:[~]<list,of,classnames>[:[~]self]]: print verbose information
 -options_file <file>: reads options from file
 -options_monitor: monitor options to standard output, including that set previously e.g. in option files
 -options_monitor_cancel: cancels all hardwired option monitors
 -petsc_sleep n: sleeps n seconds before running program
