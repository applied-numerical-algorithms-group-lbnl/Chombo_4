\begin{abstract}

Devendran, et al. \cite{Devendran2017} present an algorithm that
solves Poisson's equation to fourth-order accuracy using an EB grid.
Generalizing somewhat  the framework they present, we can define a
family of elliptic operators.   That algorithm is a special case of a
family of finite volume elliptic operators.   In part 1
\cite{Devendran2023}, we present the formal 
process to generate these operators and present system matrix
conditioning data.      Here we present how truncation error varies
within the family of operators.
