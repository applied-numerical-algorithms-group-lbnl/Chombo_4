# Chombo4/DomainDecomposition/EBCellMerge/hoeb_geometry_test inputs:
# nx                : domain is sized nx^D
# maxGrid           : maximum box size in domain decomposition
# mergeSmallCells   : true turns on cell merging (disallowing small cells)
# polynomial_order  : Order of moments (P)
# 		    
# weight_power      : exponent of distance in weight function 
#                     weight_power >= 0
#                     W = 1/D^5 (if weightpower = 5)
# stencil_radius    : number of points to grow a cell to get a neighborhood
#                     This one may be automatically grown by one in places.
# which_geom        : Magic string that tells code which implicit function to use.
#                     For now, this may be only "all_regular", "plane", or "sphere".
# graph_filename    : File in which to put an HDF5 plot of the graph map  coordinates.
#                     Useful for handy pictures of merged/unmerged configurations
# inv_cond_filename : File in  which to put hdf5 plot of the inverse of the condition number
#                     of the weighted moment matrix.  This is the important data of this
#                     particular test.
#  The prefix usually names the function which is using ParmParse unless I expect
#  to use the parameter elsewhere, in which case it gets something general, like "stencil".
