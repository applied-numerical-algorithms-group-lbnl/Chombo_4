\section{hoeb geometry test}

This test makes a single-box EBCM::MetaDataLevel.  It then makes a ton
of data on matrix conditioning in an hoeb/ebcm context.    The
associated technical report is quite complete.

\section{hoeb spmd}

This tests the communications infrastructure for {\tt
Chombo4/src/EBCM}, the bits of Chombo that handle calculations
within the context of  cut cell geometries where merger is an option.
The associated document is complete but minimal.


\section{hoeb petsc}

This test investigates the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of stencils to
solve Poisson's equation.   First it checks condition numbers when
boundary condition equations are added.    The associated document is
complete to the point of being downright chatty.
